//! # Upgrade Simulation Test Harness — Issue #310 + #432
//!
//! Creates a repeatable test harness that:
//! 1. Deploys `LegacyV0Contract` (schema version 0) and populates a "golden state"
//!    fixture covering escrows in multiple lifecycle states, fee configuration,
//!    privacy settings, and the escrow counter.
//! 2. Performs an in-place upgrade to `QuickexContract` (v1) via `env.register_at`,
//!    then calls `migrate()`.
//! 3. Validates all invariants and data integrity after the upgrade.
//! 4. Provides regression tests for known migration pitfalls.
//!
//! ## Acceptance criteria (Issue #310 + #432)
//! - Upgrade tests run locally and deterministically.
//! - No data loss or corruption across migrations.
//! - Invariants are validated with clear failure messages.
//! - Upgrade window gating works (blocks outside window).
//! - Post-upgrade invariants enforced deterministically (AC2).
//! - Upgrade start/complete events emitted for indexing (AC3).
//!
//! ## Running
//! ```sh
//! cargo test upgrade_harness_ -- --nocapture
//! cargo test upgrade_safety_gate_ -- --nocapture
//! ```

/// Key differences from the current `QuickexContract`:
/// - `initialize` omits `set_contract_version` — simulates a deployment that

/// - All escrow/privacy/dispute functions delegate to the current crate modules
